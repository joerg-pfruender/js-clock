Time input for Javascript
=========================

I have been annoyed by clicking three dozen times with my mouse to select a time on a web page.
I do not want to switch from my mouse to the keyboard and back again.

That's why I tried to create an easy-to-use input element for time.
You can select the time by dragging the mouse hand around.


This is still under heavy development.
